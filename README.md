🇮🇳 GraphRAG-Hindi: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Hindi Text

Welcome to GraphRAG-Hindi, an open-source project that brings graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to the Hindi language using publicly available datasets and open-source models. The goal is to build an intelligent QA/summarization system that retrieves relevant context via knowledge graphs and generates natural Hindi responses using state-of-the-art language models.

⸻

Why This Project?

Most retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines are focused on English or multilingual text, but they often lack deep support for Indian languages. This project is an effort to:
	•	Explore GraphRAG architecture using Hindi datasets.
	•	Combine semantic understanding with structural relationships through knowledge graphs.
	•	Enable query-focused summarization for long, noisy, real-world data (e.g., Wikipedia, monolingual corpora).
	•	Open up a path for RAG systems in Indian public administration, policy, education, and more.

Project Pipeline

	Inspired by Microsoft’s From Local to Global: A Graph-Based Query-Focused Summarization and other leading papers in Graph-RAG.

Breakdown:
	•	Preprocessing: Clean raw data (stopword removal, normalization, tokenization).
	•	Text Chunking: Use sentence segmentation to break long documents.
	•	Element Summarization: Create summaries for each chunk (fine-tuned summarizer).
	•	Graph Construction: Create nodes for chunks and connect them based on semantic similarity.
	•	Community Detection: Cluster similar chunks (e.g., using Louvain or Leiden).
	•	Query-Time Generation: Retrieve relevant communities and generate answers using IndicGPT or similar models.
